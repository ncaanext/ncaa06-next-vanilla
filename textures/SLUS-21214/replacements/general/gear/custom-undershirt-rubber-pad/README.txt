Replace this RUBBER PAD elbow equipment to give your player a short sleeve undershirt. Note that some jersey textures already have a small undershirt sleeve. This texture extends below that, and it will look best if the two match in color.

To use, find your team's short undershirt sleeve in the team's folder in "alternate_replacements" (or create your own), and copy to this folder.

The file should be named:

3a30272f374c5d47-dfc7df6e50c2d5c1-00005993.png"

Delete or rename any existing files with that name. As with all replacement textures, make sure there is only one file with that name in the entire replacements folder. 

You can make these any color or design you like, but keep in mind that they will appear on any player on any team that has RUBBER PAD elbow equipment. No players in the default mod roster have this equipment, and the CPU will never give incoming recruits this or assign it to CPU teams in your dynasty, so it is generally safe to use.
