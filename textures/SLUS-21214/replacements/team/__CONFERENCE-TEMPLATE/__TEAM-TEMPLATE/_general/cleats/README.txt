Don't forget to add textures for the taped versions of the shoe -- white tape, black tape, and team color tape.

NOTE: If your team uses black cleats in the base game, replacing the texture will affect other teams. If the team uses white cleats in the base game, they will most likely be unique and not affect other teams.
