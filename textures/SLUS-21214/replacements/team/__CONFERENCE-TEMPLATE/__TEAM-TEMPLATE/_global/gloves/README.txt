These are general gear replacements and override equipment for all teams (but no CPU teams should be using this gear). You may only use for one team at a time. 

Do not put them in your team folder in replacements. They should be copied to replacements-->general-->gear-->[corresponding folder]. 

See the README.txt in the destination folder for more information.
